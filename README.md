# MyFridge

MyFridge lets users input what is in their fridge and the amount pulls up recipes pertaining to those items. There would be selections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. The recipe provides the calorie count as well as the ingredients and how to make it. If you do not have the item on the list then you can have the option to save the recipes under another tab and also create a grocery list under another featured tab.
