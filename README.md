The MyFridge App is intended to allow users to input the food items in their food items in their kitchens get recipe suggestions that would utilize these food items as ingredients. If the entered items are close to completing a recipe, the user will be asked if they want to see the missing ingredients. The user will then be able to use these missing ingredients to create a shopping list of needed items.
